Hello! Welcome to my paycheck expression. I created a script to determin how much money I make (before taxes) in a
two-week pay period. So every two weeks I get payed. Right now I make 16 dollars an hour. Wow! That's a lot. I work
40 hours a week, for 5 days, your typical monday - friday job. According to my math, I make $1,280.00 every two weeks.
Now that's a nice chunk of change.

However, I didn't make the script just for myself. If you would like to see how much YOU make in a bi-weekly basis,
Or if you just want to see if I did the math right, use my script. In order to see where the number is to indicate my
paycheck, run the script in your default browser, follow the onscreen prompts, and view the number inside the console.
